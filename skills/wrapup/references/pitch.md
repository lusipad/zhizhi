# Pitch & Explainer Doc

Reviewers start with the same unknowns the user started with. A good pitch doc walks
them through faster, and shows experts that the failure points they'd probe were already
accounted for. Answer their first three questions before they ask.

**Language:** templates and section names in this file are the spec, not literal output —
the doc is written in its audience's language (match the repo's PR/doc convention). Code
identifiers, file paths, and anchor tokens (CONFIRMED / FALSE / UNVERIFIABLE, PASS /
NOT YET) stay in English.

## One document, in this order

1. **The demo** — GIF/screenshot/link, first thing visible. One caption line. For
   non-visual work the demo is a terminal transcript or test run showing the
   before/after behavior — same rule: visible first, one caption.
2. **What & why** — two paragraphs max: the problem, and why now.
3. **The decisions that matter** — the 2–4 choices a reviewer would push on, each with
   the reasoning and the rejected alternative. Pull from the plan's "most likely to
   tweak" section and the decision log. No plan or decision log? Derive the decisions
   from the diff and write the reasoning as present-tense justification ("we use X
   because…") — never as narrated history ("we considered Y and rejected it") unless
   that consideration is actually on record.
4. **Unknowns we found and answered** — potholes discovered along the way (from the
   blindspot briefing and the notes' Deviations/Surprises) and how each was handled.
   This is the section that converts experts: their anticipated objections, already met.
5. **What we didn't do** — explicit non-goals and known limitations. Preempts the
   "but what about…" thread.
6. **How to try it** — exact commands or steps, copy-pasteable.
7. **Risks & rollback** — what could go wrong and how to undo it.

## Fit the channel

Default: a single Markdown document that drops cleanly into Slack or a PR description.
For a standalone page (design review, wider audience): one self-contained HTML file,
same structure, demo media embedded.

## Quality bar

- A reviewer who reads only the demo and section 3 should already lean yes.
- Every "it works" claim is backed by something visible: a test name, a screenshot, a
  command output.
- No section over ~150 words except the decisions section. Cut until it hurts, then stop.
